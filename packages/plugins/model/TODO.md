## TODO

- Find a better name for this plugin.

- Currently, this just exposes a name and location property. It should instead offer a hierarchy of things, and allow for creating container things tagged as Rooms and Buildings.

- This needs to expose its name as the title property. Needs support from core to do that. Some devices may define their own names, such as scenes. We should detect this and not define our own name property in this case.
